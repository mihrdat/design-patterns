Polymorphism is a mechanism that allows you to call the same method on different objects and get different behaviors.

Abstract methods are methods that are declared, but contain no implementation. 
They are meant to be overridden by subclasses. Python does not have a built-in way to define abstract methods, but 
Python's abc module can be used to solve this problem.

State pattern allows an object to behave differently when its state changes.
