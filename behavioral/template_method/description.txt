In Python, the single underscore prefix is just a convention and does not prevent you from accessing the method. 
Unlike languages like Java, Python does not have strict access modifiers to enforce encapsulation. The single underscore prefix 
is a hint to the programmer that the method or attribute is intended for internal use within the class, subclass or module.
If you want to make it harder (but not impossible) to access a method, you can use a double underscore prefix. This 
will "mangle" the method name, making it harder to access unintentionally.
